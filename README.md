# My website for Git introduction

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## What this project was for
This project was used to complete the module for code institute involving GIT commands
It covered aspects such as adding files, removing them and add / pushing etc.

I also took the time to look up some GIT commands myself to run such as git rm to remove a file created in the main directory.
